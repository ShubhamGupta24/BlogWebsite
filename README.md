MERN Blogging Application - Backend
Welcome to the backend of our MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Blogging Application! This backend server is built using Express.js and Node.js, leveraging the power of MongoDB for data storage. We have integrated Zod for data validation to ensure the security and integrity of our application. The server will be hosted on port 5000.

Features
RESTful API: The backend provides a RESTful API for performing CRUD operations on blog posts and user data.
Zod Validation: Data received by the API endpoints is validated using Zod schemas to maintain data integrity.
MongoDB Integration: MongoDB is used as the database to store blog posts and user information.
Token-based Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for user authentication and authorization.
